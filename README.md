# digitalCombinationLock

As part of CS303 Logic and Digital System Design course, we were asked to design a digital combination lock using both HDL and schematic designs. This circuit is expected to have unique codes for up to 100 users , expected to identify themselves by the use of a 2-digit decimal number.
